## Features
- A single page application that allows users to make an order from Thai Time, a fictional restaurant.
- After placing an order, the restaurant receives an message outlining the order the client just made. The restaurant responds and the customer receives a message about how long until his meal will be ready for pickup. Once the restaurant sends the text, the page auto updates, without refresh, to display how long until the meal is ready. 
-The project is hosted on Heroku
